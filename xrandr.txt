MULTI-MONITOR SETUP
-------------------

In multi-monitor situations, you will probably need to run some
xrandr settings. For example, considering a laptop with an external
monitor to the right of it, the following command would 'extend' the
display (rather than the default mirroring), and set the correct
resolution for both displays:

  $ xrandr --auto --output LVDS --primary --mode 1366x768 \
  --left-of VGA-0 --output VGA-0 --mode 1280x1024

To determine your optimal resolutions and display names, simply run:

  $ xrandr -q

To make this change permanent simply place the xrandr command before
'exec dwm' in your '.xinitrc'.

You can also place these settings in other startup files, for
example '~/.fluxbox/startup'.
